        body: `<p>RockÉTS is a rocketry science club at École de Technologie Supérieure. The club has more than 40 students from all engineering branches that are passionate about space and science. RockÉTS's mission is to share our knowledge, as well as our motivation to everyone around us. To make this happen, we participate in several events and gatherings for all different age and interest groups.</p>
        <p>More particularly, we represent ÉTS at the annual Spaceport America Cup competition. This competition takes place in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in the beginning of June. During this event, we share and celebrate the work done throughout the year with other rocketry clubs from around the world and anyone who are interested in seeing an aerospace show.</p>
        <p>Finally, RockÉTS is proud to contribute to the development of the future aerospace industry. We seek to push our limits and continue our journey with advancements with the help from our partners.</p>`
